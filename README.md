Install IntelliJ and PGAdmin for Database. Also download and install Java 11 or JDK 11. I used jfx13 and you can download it on https://openjfx.io/

You need to configure first the IntelliJ and insert all of this jar libraries. Download all the libraries.

# Getting Started

If you want to develop a system using JavaFX and PostgreSQL, this project might help you. 
I used JDK 11 because it's LTS (long term support) and some codes are not working at JDK 13.
